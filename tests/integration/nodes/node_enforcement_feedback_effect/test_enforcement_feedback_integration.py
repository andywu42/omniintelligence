"""Integration tests for enforcement feedback effect node.

These tests require a running PostgreSQL database with the learned_patterns
table. They verify that the handler correctly reads and writes quality_score
values in a real database.

Marked with @pytest.mark.integration - skipped when infrastructure is unavailable.

        This test is skipped when the database is not available.

        Implementation notes:
        - Use db_conn (asyncpg connection) to INSERT a row into learned_patterns
          with a known quality_score (e.g. 0.8) and status='provisional'.
        - Build a ModelEnforcementEvent with one ModelPatternViolation where
          was_advised=True and was_corrected=True (confirmed violation).
        - Wrap db_conn in a ProtocolPatternRepository adapter and call
          process_enforcement_feedback(event, repository=repo).
        - Assert result.status == EnumEnforcementFeedbackStatus.SUCCESS.

          with LEAST(GREATEST(quality_score + $2, 0.0), 1.0)).

        Implementation notes:
        - Insert a test pattern into learned_patterns with a known quality_score.

          contract.yaml for node_enforcement_feedback_effect).
        - Start NodeClaudeHookEventEffect (or NodeEnforcementFeedbackEffect)
          with the real Kafka consumer and PostgreSQL repository wired together.
        - Wait (with timeout) for the consumer to process the message.
        - SELECT quality_score FROM learned_patterns WHERE id=<pattern_id> and
          assert it was decremented by CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENT_PER_VIOLATION (-0.01).
        - Assert result.status in {SUCCESS, PARTIAL_SUCCESS} from the handler.
        - Clean up: DELETE test pattern and reset Kafka consumer offset or use
          a unique group_id per test run to avoid replaying stale messages.
