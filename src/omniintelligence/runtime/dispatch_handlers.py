"""Dispatch bridge handlers for Intelligence domain.

Bridge handlers that adapt between the MessageDispatchEngine
handler signature and existing Intelligence domain handlers. It also defines
topic alias mappings needed because ONEX canonical topic naming uses ``.cmd.``
and ``.evt.`` segments, which EnumMessageCategory.from_topic() does not yet
recognize (it expects ``.commands.`` and ``.events.``).

Design Decisions:
    - Topic aliases are a temporary bridge until EnumMessageCategory.from_topic()
      is updated to handle ``.cmd.`` / ``.evt.`` short forms.
    - Bridge handlers adapt (envelope, context) -> existing handler interfaces.
    - The dispatch engine is created per-plugin (not kernel-managed).
    - message_types=None on handler registration accepts all message types in
      the category -- correct when routing by topic, not type.
    - All required dependencies (repository, idempotency_store, intent_classifier)
      must be provided -- no fallback stubs. If deps are missing, the plugin
      must not start consumers.

Related:
    - OMN-2031: Replace _noop_handler with MessageDispatchEngine routing
    - OMN-2032: Register intelligence dispatchers (now 8 unconditional handlers, 10 routes + 1 conditional)
    - OMN-934: MessageDispatchEngine implementation
    - OMN-2339: Add node_compliance_evaluate_effect and its dispatcher
