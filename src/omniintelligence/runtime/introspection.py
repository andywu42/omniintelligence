"""Intelligence node introspection registration.

Publishes introspection events for all intelligence nodes during plugin
initialization, enabling them to be discovered by the registration
orchestrator in omnibase_infra.

This module bridges the gap between intelligence nodes (which run inside
the plugin lifecycle, not as standalone processes) and the platform
registration system (which discovers nodes via introspection events on
``onex.evt.platform.node-introspection.v1``).

Design Decisions:
    - Introspection is published per-node, not per-plugin. Each intelligence
      node gets its own introspection event with its own node_id.
    - The plugin owns the event bus reference and passes it to this module.
    - Heartbeat is enabled for effect nodes only (they have long-running
      consumers). Compute nodes are stateless and do not need heartbeats.
    - Node IDs are deterministic UUIDs derived from the node name using
      uuid5(NAMESPACE_DNS, node_name) for stable registration across restarts.
