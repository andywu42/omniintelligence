"""Handler functions for pattern projection snapshot publishing.

Projection publish logic: querying all
validated/provisional patterns and publishing a full materialized snapshot
to the pattern-projection Kafka topic.

Design Principles:
    - Fire-and-forget Kafka emission: failures are logged but never propagated.
      The handler always returns a result; the snapshot is best-effort.
    - correlation_id threaded from the triggering lifecycle event through to
      the snapshot payload for end-to-end tracing.
    - snapshot_at is injected by the caller (no datetime.now() in model).
    - No blocking on Kafka — await producer.publish() with non-blocking
      protocol semantics; exceptions caught and logged.
    - Protocol-based dependency injection for testability.

    """Query all validated patterns and publish a full materialized snapshot.

    On each trigger (pattern promoted, deprecated, or lifecycle-transitioned):
    1. Query all validated/provisional patterns via pattern_query_store
    2. Build a ModelPatternProjectionEvent snapshot with explicit snapshot_at
    3. Publish the snapshot to the projection topic (fire-and-forget)
    4. Return the snapshot model regardless of Kafka publish outcome

    Fire-and-Forget Emission:
        If the Kafka producer is None or raises, the exception is caught and
        logged. The handler always returns the built snapshot. Callers receive
        the snapshot model even if Kafka publication failed.

    Args:
        pattern_query_store: REQUIRED store for querying validated patterns.
        producer: Optional Kafka publisher. When None, the snapshot is built
            but not published to Kafka (graceful degradation).
        correlation_id: Correlation ID from the triggering lifecycle event.
            Threaded into the snapshot payload for distributed tracing.
        publish_topic: Full Kafka topic string for the projection event.
            Required when producer is not None; ignored when producer is None.
        trigger_event_type: Event type string of the triggering event
            (e.g. "PatternPromoted"). Used for logging only.
        triggering_pattern_id: Pattern ID from the triggering event.
            Used for logging only.

    Returns:
        ModelPatternProjectionEvent containing the full pattern snapshot.
        Always returned — Kafka failures do not prevent snapshot construction.
