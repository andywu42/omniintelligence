"""Handler functions for session outcome recording with rolling window metrics.

Pattern feedback loop: when a Claude Code session
completes (success or failure), we update the rolling metrics for all patterns
that were injected during that session.

Rolling Window Decay Approximation:
-----------------------------------
We maintain rolling_20 counters that approximate the last ROLLING_WINDOW_SIZE
injections. Since true sliding windows require storing per-injection timestamps,
we use a decay approximation:

- When adding a success: increment success_count, decrement failure_count if at cap
- When adding a failure: increment failure_count, decrement success_count if at cap

This ensures:
1. Counters never exceed ROLLING_WINDOW_SIZE (the window size)
2. The ratio reflects recent performance, not all-time performance
3. Old outcomes are "forgotten" as new ones arrive

Contribution Heuristics (OMN-1679):
-----------------------------------
When recording outcomes, we compute contribution heuristics to attribute
the outcome to individual patterns. This is explicitly a HEURISTIC, not
causal attribution - multi-injection sessions make true attribution impossible.

Three methods are supported:
- EQUAL_SPLIT: Each pattern gets 1/N credit
- RECENCY_WEIGHTED: Later patterns get more credit (linear ramp)
- FIRST_MATCH: All credit to the first pattern

Idempotency: Heuristics are only computed for injections where
contribution_heuristic IS NULL, preventing retry overwrites.

Reference:
    - OMN-1679: FEEDBACK-004 contribution heuristic for outcome attribution
    - OMN-1678: Implement rolling window metric updates with decay approximation
    - OMN-1677: Pattern feedback effect node foundation

Design Principles:
    - Pure handler functions with injected repository
    - Protocol-based dependency injection for testability
    - asyncpg-style positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)

ROLLING_WINDOW_SIZE: int = 20
"""The number of recent injections tracked for rolling window metrics.

This constant defines the size of the rolling window used for pattern
performance metrics. The rolling window approximates tracking the last
N injections per pattern using a decay algorithm rather than storing
individual timestamps.

When metrics reach this cap:
- New outcomes increment their respective counter (success/failure)
- The opposite counter is decremented to approximate "forgetting" old data
- Total injection count is capped at this value

Database columns (injection_count_rolling_20, success_count_rolling_20,
failure_count_rolling_20) use this value in their naming convention.
Changing this constant requires a corresponding database migration.

    7. Return result with status, counts, pattern_ids, and effectiveness scores

    Args:
        session_id: The Claude Code session ID.
        success: Whether the session succeeded.
        failure_reason: Optional reason for failure (ignored if success=True).
        repository: Database repository implementing ProtocolPatternRepository.

        heuristic_method: Method for computing contribution attribution.
            Defaults to EQUAL_SPLIT. See EnumHeuristicMethod for options.
        producer: Optional Kafka producer for emitting quality-assessment commands.
            When provided, publishes one command per pattern to trigger quality
            scoring. Operation succeeds regardless of Kafka availability — if
            producer is None or publish fails, a warning is logged and the

    Returns:
        ModelSessionOutcomeResult with status, counts, and effectiveness scores.

    Raises:
        Exception: Propagates database errors for caller to handle.

    Note:
        Transaction Handling: This function executes multiple queries (fetch,
        then two updates) without explicit transaction management. If atomicity
        is required, the caller must provide a repository/connection that is
        already within a transaction context. Without a transaction, if a query
        fails mid-execution (e.g., the second update fails after the first
        succeeds), data may be left in an inconsistent state where injections
        are marked as recorded but pattern metrics are not updated.

        Partial Failure Recovery: If the caller passes a pool-backed repository
        without an explicit transaction (e.g., AdapterPatternRepositoryRuntime),
        each SQL statement auto-commits independently. A crash after step 3
        (mark injections recorded) but before step 5 (update rolling metrics)
        leaves the session permanently marked as processed while metrics are
        never updated. Re-running returns ALREADY_RECORDED, making metrics
        permanently skewed. Recovery requires manual SQL to reset
        ``outcome_recorded = FALSE`` and ``outcome_recorded_at = NULL``
        for affected sessions in the ``pattern_injections`` table.

        Heuristic Idempotency: Contribution heuristics are only written for
        injections where contribution_heuristic IS NULL. This prevents retries
        from overwriting previously computed attributions.
