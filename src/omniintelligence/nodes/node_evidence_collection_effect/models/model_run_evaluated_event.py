        task_class: Task class for which the evaluation was performed.
        bundle_fingerprint: SHA-256 fingerprint of the evidence bundle.
        passed: True if all hard gates passed; False otherwise.
        failures: Gate IDs that failed (empty if passed=True).
        score_correctness: Correctness dimension of the score vector.
