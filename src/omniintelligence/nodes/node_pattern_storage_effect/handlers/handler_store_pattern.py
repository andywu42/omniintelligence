"""Handler for pattern storage operations.

Handler function for persisting learned patterns
to storage with governance invariants, idempotency, and version tracking.

Key Invariants:
    - Governance: Confidence must be >= 0.5 (MIN_CONFIDENCE)
    - Uniqueness: UNIQUE(domain, signature_hash, version)
    - Current Tracking: UNIQUE(domain, signature_hash) WHERE is_current = true
    - Immutable History: Never overwrite existing patterns, create new version
    - Idempotency: Same (pattern_id, signature_hash) returns same result

Lineage Key:
    Patterns are uniquely identified by (domain, signature_hash) for
    deduplication and version tracking across pattern versions.
    signature_hash is a stable SHA256 hash, while signature is raw text
    that could change format.

class ProtocolPatternStore(Protocol):
    """Protocol for pattern storage operations.

    Defines the interface for persisting patterns to a database or other
    storage backend. Implementations must support version tracking via
    the is_current flag for lineage management.

    Database Schema Requirements:
        - UNIQUE(domain, signature_hash, version): No duplicate versions
        - UNIQUE(domain, signature_hash) WHERE is_current = true: Only one current
        - pattern_state_transitions table: Audit trail (future)

    Implementations should handle:
        - Idempotent storage (same pattern_id + signature_hash returns existing)
        - Version management (is_current flag transitions)
        - Atomic operations (set_previous_not_current + store_pattern)

    Transaction Support:
        All methods accept a `conn` parameter. When `conn` is provided,
        the operation uses that connection (enabling external transaction control).
        When None, implementations may use their own connection management.

    Transaction Semantics (Implementation-Specific):
        The `conn` parameter is provided for external transaction control.
        However, implementation behavior varies:

        - Some implementations honor `conn` and participate in caller-managed
          transactions (e.g., test mocks, direct psycopg adapters)
        - Some implementations manage their own connections (e.g., pool-based
          adapters like AdapterPatternStore) and may ignore the `conn` parameter

        Callers should verify implementation behavior if transaction atomicity
        is critical for their use case.

        For guaranteed atomicity in version transitions, prefer using
        `store_with_version_transition()` which uses a single SQL CTE and
        does not depend on external transaction management.

    IMPORTANT: Implementations MUST ensure that set_previous_not_current() and
    store_pattern() are executed atomically (within a single database transaction).
    If store_pattern fails after set_previous_not_current succeeds, the lineage
    would be left without a current version, violating invariants. The handler
    cannot enforce this at the protocol level, so implementations are responsible
    for wrapping these operations in a transaction.

        This is the PREFERRED method for storing new versions of existing patterns.
        It combines set_previous_not_current and store_pattern into a single atomic
        SQL operation, preventing the invariant violation where a lineage has ZERO
        current versions.

        Lineage lookup uses (domain, signature_hash) for stable identity.
        The signature parameter is stored as raw text for display/debugging.

        Atomicity Guarantee
        -------------------
        This method guarantees that either:
        - Both the UPDATE (set previous versions non-current) AND INSERT succeed, OR
        - Neither operation takes effect (full rollback)

        This is achieved by using a CTE (Common Table Expression) that performs
        both operations in a single SQL statement within the database's implicit
        transaction boundary.

        CRITICAL INVARIANT PROTECTED:
            UNIQUE(domain, signature_hash) WHERE is_current = true
            (Exactly one current version per lineage)

        FAILURE SCENARIO WITHOUT THIS METHOD:
            If set_previous_not_current() succeeds but store_pattern() fails:
            - All previous versions have is_current=false
            - No new version is inserted
            - RESULT: Lineage has ZERO current versions (invariant violated)
            - IMPACT: Pattern lookups for "current" version return nothing

        When to Use This Method
        -----------------------
        Use this method when:
        - Storing a new version of an existing pattern (version > 1)
        - Atomicity is critical (production workloads)
        - You cannot guarantee external transaction wrapping

        Use store_pattern instead when:
        - Storing a brand new pattern (first version, no previous versions exist)
        - You have already wrapped operations in an external transaction

        Args:
            pattern_id: Unique identifier for this pattern instance.
            signature: The pattern signature (behavioral/structural fingerprint).
            signature_hash: Hash of the signature for efficient lookup.
            domain: Domain where the pattern was learned.
            version: Version number (MUST be > latest existing version).
            confidence: Confidence score at storage time.
            state: Initial state of the pattern.
            is_current: Ignored by atomic operation - always stored as TRUE.
            stored_at: Timestamp when the pattern was stored.
            actor: Identifier of the entity that stored the pattern.
            source_run_id: ID of the run that produced this pattern.

        Returns:
            UUID of the stored pattern (same as pattern_id).
