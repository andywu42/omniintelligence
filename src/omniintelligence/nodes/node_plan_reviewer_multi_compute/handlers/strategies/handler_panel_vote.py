"""S1 — panel_vote strategy handler for NodePlanReviewerMultiCompute.

All four models review the plan independently and in parallel.  A finding
is included in the output only if **at least two** models agree on the
same ``(category, location_normalized)`` pair.

Confidence formula::

    confidence = Σ(weight[m] for m in agreeing_models)
               / Σ(weight[m] for m in all_participating_models)

The patch for an included finding is taken from the agreeing model with
the highest accuracy weight.
