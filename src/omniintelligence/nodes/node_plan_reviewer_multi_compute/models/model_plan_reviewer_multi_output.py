    """Output of the multi-LLM plan reviewer node.

    Returned by ``handle_plan_reviewer_multi_compute`` after all strategy
    handlers complete.  The model is frozen so it can be safely cached or
    passed between threads.

    Attributes:
        strategy_run_id: UUID of the row inserted into
            ``plan_reviewer_strategy_runs``.  ``None`` when the DB write
            was skipped (``strategy_run_stored=False``).
        strategy: The review strategy that was executed.
        models_used: The model IDs that participated in this run.
        findings: Merged findings with per-finding confidence scores.
            Empty list = plan is clean (no issues found).
        findings_count: ``len(findings)`` — convenience field for callers
            that only need the count.
        strategy_run_stored: ``True`` when the audit row was successfully
            written to ``plan_reviewer_strategy_runs``.  ``False`` when the
            DB was unavailable; the review result itself is still valid.
        run_id: Echo of the caller-supplied ``run_id`` from the input
            command.
