Shared Constants for OmniIntelligence.

This module defines constants used across multiple modules to avoid magic numbers
and improve code readability and maintainability.

Usage:
    from omniintelligence.constants import PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER

    hit_rate = (hits / total) * PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER

# Percentage and Rate Calculations
# =============================================================================

PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER: int = 100
"""
Multiplier for converting ratios (0.0-1.0) to percentages (0-100).

Used in rate calculations such as cache hit rates, pass rates, and
completion percentages. Multiply a ratio by this constant to get a
percentage value.

Example:
    ratio = 0.75
    percentage = ratio * PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER  # 75.0

# Pattern Matching Limits
# =============================================================================

MAX_PATTERN_MATCH_RESULTS: int = 100
"""
Maximum number of pattern match results that can be returned.

This limit prevents excessive memory usage and response sizes when
querying for pattern matches. Pattern matching operations should not
return more than this many results.

Used in:
    - ModelPatternContext.max_results validation
    - Pattern matching compute node operations

# TEMP_BOOTSTRAP: These constants are temporary until runtime injection from
# contract.yaml is wired end-to-end. Delete when OMN-1546 completes.
#
# Topic naming follows ONEX convention:
#   onex.{type}.{domain}.{event-name}.{version}

# The dispatch engine reads canonical topics from contract.yaml and uses them
# directly (no env prefix). These constants match the contract declarations.
#
# NOTE: The TOPIC_SUFFIX_ prefix is a legacy naming artifact. The dispatch engine
# uses these as canonical topics (no prefix).
# The names will be removed entirely with OMN-1546; renaming is not worthwhile.
